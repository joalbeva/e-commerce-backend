Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. The goal of this project was to understand the fundamental architecture of these platforms. 

The E-Commerce Backend is a REST API for an internet retail website. The API is built onto an Express.js server that uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/) to interact with a MySQL database. Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM(Object Relation Mapping) for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.

This E-Commerce backend has the API routes that point to each of the standard [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations for each data group. The routes can be used to:
- Create categories, products, tags
- View categories, products, tags
- Establish associations between the different entities
- Update categories, products, & tags
- Delete entries from the database

All that's missing to make this a complete E-Commerce website is a simple front-end application that makes calls to the API routes that are already built-in. If that's too much, simply try making requests to the API routes from your browser to the see the raw data that's returned.

## **Installation**

Start with cloning this repo on your local machine:

```sh
$ git clone mygit
$ cd e-commerce-backend
```

To install and set up the application, run:
```sh
$ npm install employee-tracker
```

You will also need to place a .env file in the root directory of the project, in order to connect to your MySQL database. Here's an example:

file: .env
```
DB_NAME=library_db
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_USER=root
```

---

## **Usage**
<sub><sup>This section assumes you have installed the application, and created the .env file in the root directory.</sub></sup>

To finish the set-up the application, complete the following steps:
1. Create a MySQL database on your local machine using the *schema.sql* file located in the /db/ directory(From the MySQL CLI, source db/schema.sql)
2. Seed the database with sample data to be used for testing purposes(Run *npm run seed* from inside the root directory of the project)

Now you're ready to start the application! You can start the server by running: 
```
npm start
```

The server is running, now you can make requests to it through your desired method. If you're new to the backend, I suggest trying out [Postman](postman.com)
